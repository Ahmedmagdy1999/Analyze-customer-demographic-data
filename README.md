# 🧠 Customer Demographic Analysis – Excel Project

This project is a freelance data analysis task I completed for a client, focused on understanding customer behavior and demographics to support data-driven marketing and business decisions.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze customer data based on demographic features (age, gender, location, income) and behavioral indicators (purchase frequency, total spend, preferred channels), and extract actionable insights that can guide marketing and operational strategies.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset included the following fields:

- Customer ID  
- Age  
- Gender  
- Location  
- Income Level (EGP)  
- Education Level  
- Purchase Frequency  
- Total Spent (EGP)  
- Preferred Channel  

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables  
- Custom Formulas (IF, GROUPING)  
- Conditional Formatting  
- Charts and Visualizations  

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

- **Segmentation by Age Group**: Identified top spending age segments.
- **Income Group Analysis**: Measured total spending by income levels.
- **Location-Based Purchase Frequency**: Ranked regions by engagement.
- **Channel Preference by Gender**: Analyzed shopping behavior differences between males and females.
- **Insights Summary Sheet**: Collected all findings in a readable format.

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Middle-aged customers** were the top spenders, contributing over **EGP 23.5 million**.

- **Females slightly preferred the website**, while **males leaned toward in-store shopping**, though overall channel preferences were balanced.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
